// Function Arguments

While calling a function, the arguments can be passed to a function in two ways, Call by value and call by reference.

Call by Value
    The actual parameter is passed to a function.
    New memory area created for the passsed parameters, can be used only within the functions.
    The actual parameters cannot be modified here.

Call by Reference
    Instead of copying variable; an address is passed to function as parameters.
    Address operator(&) is used in the parameter of the called function.
    Changes in function reflecct the change of the original variables.
