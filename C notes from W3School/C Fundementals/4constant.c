Constants are fixed values used in a program, and its value remains the same during execution of the program

Constants are also called literals
Constants can be any of the data types
Best practice for using constants are only using UPPER-CASE names

const keyword defines a constant in C 

-----example-----

Two types of constant in C 

1. Numeric Constants 
    Interger Constants 
    Real Constants 

2. Character Constants 
    Single Character Constants 
    String Constants 
    Backslash Character Constants 

-----Numeric Constants-----

Integer Constants 
    1. Decimal Integer
    2. Octal Integer
    3. Hexadecimal Integer
EX. 15, -265, 0, 99818, +25, 045, 0X6

Real Constants 
    The numbers containing fractional parts like 99.25 are called real or floating points constants.

-----Character Constants-----

Single Character Constants

    '8' is not the same as 8.
    Character constnts have a specific set of integer values known as ASCII

    \v vertical tab
    \' single quote '
    \" double quote "
