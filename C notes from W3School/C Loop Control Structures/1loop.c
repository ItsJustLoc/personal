// Loops 

A loop executes a block of commands a specified number of times until a condition is met.
The process of repeatedly executing a collection of statements is called looping.
The statements get executed many numbers of times based on the condition.
But if the condition is given in such logic that the repetition continues any number of times with no fixed condition to stop looping those statements, then this type of looping is called infinite looping.

C supports the following types of loops:
    while loops
    do-while loops
    for loops

C Loop Control Statements

break statement - break; - Its used to terminate loop or switch statements
continue statement - continue; - Its used to suspend the current loop iteration and transfer control to the loop for the next iteration.
goto statement - goto labelName; - labelName: statement; - It transfers the current program execution sequence to some other part of the program.
