// Decision Making 

Conditional statements allow you to make a decision, based upon results of a condition.
All set of statements in a C program gets executed sequentially in the order in which they are written and appear.
This occurs when there is no jump based statements or repetitions of certain calculations.
Situations may arise where we may have to change the order of execution of statements depending on some specific conditions.
This takes a kind of decision making from a set of calculations.
C language asumes any non-zero or non-null value as true and if zero or null, treated as false.
