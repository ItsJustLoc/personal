Python is a popular programming language.
It was created by Guido van Rossum, and was released in 1991.

Its used for:
    
    Web development(server-side)
    Software development
    Mathematics
    System Scripting

What can Python do?

    Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
    Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
    Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
    Python can be used to handle big data amd perform complex mathematics.
    Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

Why Python?

    Python works on different platforms.
    Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
    Python has ssyntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
    Python runs on interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written.
    This means that prototyping can be very quick. 
    Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

Good to knows 

    The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial.
    Python 2, altough not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still popular.

Python Syntax compared to other programming languages.
    
    Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
    Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or paraentheses.
    Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes.
    Other programming languages often use curly-brakets for this purpose.
